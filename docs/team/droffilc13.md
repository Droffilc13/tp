### Project: TA<sup>2</sup>

TA2 is a desktop application that offers Teaching Assistants (TA) from the School of Computing (SoC) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) a convenient and efficient way to manage student information and keep track of students' assignment submissions.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Redesign the whole interface to accommodate assignments in TA<sup>2</sup>. 
  * What it does: Added the assignment list panel to view students' assignments. Design the assignment card. Wrote the backend code for the `Assignmenmt` class and most of its components.
  * Justification: This feature is the main feature that differentiates TA<sup>2</sup> from AB3 which this project is based on. It forms the foundation for future commands that manipulate assignments.
  * Highlights: This enhancement forms the bedrock of what TA<sup>2</sup> is. Any future commands added will need assignments and assignment list panel to perform their operations. This implementation is challenging because a lot of research and trial and error to fit the panel and make sure it scales with the window. Also, the analysis of how backend code is reflected on frontend is necessary to understand how they are linked.

* **New Feature**: Update assignment list display upon successful execution of commands.
  * What it does: Bridge the outcome that happens at back end to front end. For example, deleting a student whose assignment is displayed should remove all his/her assignments in the assignment list panel as well.
  * Justification: This feature enhances the **user experience** because the user should not be using the `show` command to "refresh" the assignment list panel manually. Instead, this should be built in to make the design more intuitive.
  * Highlights: Any future commands related to assignment manipulation added will need this to perform their operations so that the front end reflects automatically the result as well. This implementation is challenging because it requires me to step into the shoes of the user and understand which operations should be automated to provide a more intuitive user experience.

* **New Feature**: Improve `give`, `remove` and `mark` assignments input format to make it less cumbersome
  * What it does: Change from `NAME` to `INDEX` to reference the student to `give` assignments to. For `remove` and `mark`, change from `NAME` to reference just the person whose assignment is currently displayed.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is faster, less cumbersome and less error-prone  to type the `INDEX` of student/assignments compared to the `NAME` of the student.
  * Highlights: This change is challenging because how the command works previously and change accordingly and have to manually update all test case to reflect the change.
  
* **New Feature**: Improve undo and redo to be able to change the state of `list` and `find` 
  * What it does: Undo and redo could only occur if the person/assignment state has changed. By storing the state of the filtered person list, `list` and `find` can also be included as well.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience because it makes sense that undo and redo should be able to return the previous action. Excluding `list` and `find` may make the product unintuitive.
  * Highlights: This change is challenging because I have to analyse how undo and redo works and how state is tracked.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases [`v1.2`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/untagged-201b35d412632ea069df), [`v1.3.trial`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.trial), [`v1.3(final)`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3(final)), [`v1.4(final)`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.4) (4 releases) on GitHub. 
  * Maintaining the issue tracker and ensure internal deadlines are met.
  * Renaming product name of application in `.fxml` file and `.jar` file in gradle.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated Ui to include assignment list panel and assignment cards. (Pull requests [\#46](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/46), [\#93](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/93), [\#76](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/pull/76))

* **Documentation**:

    * Add an introduction to user guide and add links for new/experience users.
    * Improve the quick start page
    * Read through and standardise the whole user guide.
  * Developer Guide:
